# Introduction to gmux

## Task
Write a clear, engaging introduction to `gmux`. Base the content on the `README.md`, but structure it as formal documentation.

Cover the following points:
- **What is gmux?** Explain that it's an interactive session manager for tmux, inspired by ThePrimeagen's tmux-sessionizer but deeply integrated with the Grove ecosystem.
- **What problem does it solve?** It transforms tmux from a simple multiplexer into a context-aware development environment dashboard.
- **Key Features**: Create a high-level bulleted list of the main features. Reference these files for details:
  - Live Sessionizer (`gmux sz`): `cmd/gmux/sessionize.go`, `README.md`, `LIVE_SESSIONIZER.md`
  - Interactive Key Management (`gmux key manage`): `cmd/gmux/key_manage.go`
  - Advanced Session Control (`gmux launch`): `cmd/gmux/launch.go`
  - Real-time Git and Claude AI Session Integration.

## Output Format
Provide clean, well-formatted Markdown. Start with an H1 title: `# Introduction`.
