# Getting Started with gmux

## Task
Create a step-by-step tutorial for a new user. Use the `README.md` and the first-run setup logic in `cmd/gmux/sessionize.go` as primary sources.

The guide must cover:
1.  **Step 1: First-Run Setup**: Explain the interactive setup from `gmux sz`.
2.  **Step 2: Tmux Integration**: Detail the required step of adding `source-file ~/.config/grove/generated-bindings.conf` to `~/.tmux.conf`.
3.  **Step 3: First Launch**: Instruct the user to run `gmux sz` to see their projects.

## Output Format
Provide clean Markdown with an H1 title: `# Getting Started`. Use numbered steps and code blocks.
